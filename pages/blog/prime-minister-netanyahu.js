						A Letter To Prime Minister Netanyahu

					To Prime Minister Netanyahu -- with greatest respect,
				</h2>
				<p className={styles.blogParagraph}>
					Sir, I see in you a different sort of Lion. I see one who roars from{' '}
					<em>within</em>. I see a great strategist and a cunning intellect,
					sharpened by many trials. I see that you must have learned{' '}
					<em>many</em> things from a <em>great</em> and <em>noble</em> Lion
					yourself. I can&apos;t imagine the discipline it has taken for you to
					maintain such poise while maneuvering your people through calamity
					after calamity, when surely a fire has been burning within you as
					well.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.blogParagraph}>
					I see you, Prime Minister, not only as a thinker but as a fierce
					protector. You bear your burdens -- as one who has endured personal
					loss, and as the defender of a people who have survived persecution
					throughout history -- like a crown.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.blogParagraph}>
					I never had the good fortune of meeting your honorable Yonatan; still,
					I can plainly see his strength, dignity, and legacy living on through
					you <em>and</em> the people of Israel. As an older brother myself --
					albeit one who can never hope to have the sort of impact that yours
					did -- I can only imagine how proud he would be of <em>you</em>. I
					know I would be. Humbly, Prime Minister, I believe we can both see how
					his greatest sacrifice has cleared the path which has allowed you to
					bridge so many divides already -- both within Israel and beyond. Might
					there be <em>some</em> path, achieved through peace, to build upon
					that already strong legacy into the future?
				</p>
				<p className={styles.blogParagraph}>
					Unequivocally, the Israeli people -- and the state which protects them
					-- deserve to exist. Your people have a <em>right</em> to existence{' '}
					<em>and</em> to security. I&apos;d never ask you to abandon those
					truths. Many crimes have been committed against your people throughout
					history. Each time, you <em>and</em> your people have demonstrated
					unmatched resilience.
				</p>
				<p className={styles.blogParagraph}>
					Might we take the Oslo Accords as a reasonable first step -- a rough
					draft, of sorts -- toward a more refined vision of peace and security?
					How might one of the greatest strategic minds alive today maneuver to
					set his own legacy, carrying forward the enduring torch of your
					brother, Yoni, and the relentless determination of David Ben-Gurion,
					who fought to raise <em>another</em> David&apos;s Shield above every
					child of Israel?
				</p>
				<p className={styles.blogParagraph}>
					As I close, Sir, please consider the words of a great man -- and you
					know who this man is:
				</p>
				<blockquote className={styles.quote}>
					&quot;To each, there comes in their lifetime a special moment when
					they are figuratively tapped on the shoulder and offered the chance to
					do a very special thing, unique to them and fit for your
					talents.&quot;
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Mightn&apos;t a Lion offering an olive branch qualify? If one shield
					is mighty, picture two -- one holding peace, and the other security --
					forming a <em>bulwark</em>, allowing a strategist some space to
					breathe, and
					<em>think</em> of ways to guide his people into security on the global
					stage.
				</p>
				<div className={`${styles.closing}`}>
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					<p>
						A student who hopes to witness a <em>Master</em> maneuver his people
						into, and through, an era of <em>peace</em>, <em>security</em>, and{' '}
						<em>growth</em>.
